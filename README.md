# GifTastic

Check out my implementation of [GifTastic](https://defiledspec.github.io/GifTastic) using the GIPHY API!

This app grabs **10** gifs from GIPHY using **search** and jQuery ajax to get the data.

Check out the buttons that are already there for you or add your own using the form provided at the top of the page.

Buttons you add are added to ```localStorage``` and presist on refresh, you can clear these by using the reset button in the for provided at the top of the page.

## ENJOY!
